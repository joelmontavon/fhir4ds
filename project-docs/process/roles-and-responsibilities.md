## Collaboration Framework

### Communication Patterns

**Daily Standups**
- Junior Developer reports progress, blockers, and next steps
- Senior Architect provides guidance and removes impediments
- Both discuss any architectural questions or concerns

**Weekly Planning**
- Senior Architect reviews upcoming work and creates detailed plans
- Junior Developer provides feedback on task complexity and estimates
- Both align on priorities and success criteria

**Code Reviews**
- Junior Developer submits pull requests with detailed descriptions
- Senior Architect reviews within 24 hours during business days
- Constructive feedback focuses on learning opportunities
- Multiple review rounds are expected and encouraged

### Escalation Process

**Technical Issues**
1. Junior Developer attempts solution using available resources
2. After 2 hours of blocked progress, escalate to Senior Architect
3. Senior Architect provides guidance or pair programming session
4. Document solution for future reference

**Project Issues**
1. Either role can flag risks, delays, or scope changes
2. Senior Architect assesses impact and determines response
3. Stakeholder communication handled by Senior Architect
4. Both roles collaborate on mitigation strategies

### Knowledge Transfer

**Ongoing Learning**
- Senior Architect schedules regular architecture reviews
- Junior Developer asks questions about design decisions
- Both participate in technology research and experimentation
- Document lessons learned and best practices

**Skill Development**
- Senior Architect identifies growth opportunities for Junior Developer
- Gradually increase Junior Developer's responsibility and autonomy
- Encourage Junior Developer to contribute to architectural discussions
- Support Junior Developer's professional development goals

## Quality Standards

### Code Quality Requirements

**For Both Roles**
- All code must pass automated quality checks (linting, formatting)
- Unit test coverage minimum of 80%
- No code committed without peer review
- Follow established naming conventions and style guides
- Include appropriate error handling and logging

**Senior Architect Additional Standards**
- Architectural decisions must be documented
- Performance implications must be considered and documented
- Security review required for all external interfaces
- Scalability impact must be assessed for all changes

### Git Workflow Standards

**Branching Strategy**
- Feature branches created from main/develop branch
- Branch naming: `feature/PEP-123-brief-description`
- No direct commits to main/develop branches
- Regular rebasing to keep history clean

**Commit Standards**
- Conventional commit format: `type(scope): description`
- Atomic commits that represent single logical changes
- Clear, descriptive commit messages
- Reference related issues or PEPs in commit messages

**Pull Request Process**
1. Junior Developer creates PR with detailed description
2. All tests must pass before review request
3. Senior Architect reviews within 1 business day
4. Address feedback and re-request review
5. Senior Architect approves and merges

### Documentation Standards

**Code Documentation**
- All public APIs must have comprehensive documentation
- Complex algorithms require explanatory comments
- README files for all modules/components
- Inline comments for non-obvious business logic

**Project Documentation**
- Architecture decisions recorded in ADRs (Architecture Decision Records)
- PEPs maintained for all significant changes
- User guides updated with new features
- Troubleshooting guides maintained and current

## Performance Expectations
