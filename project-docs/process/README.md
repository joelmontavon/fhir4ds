# Process Documentation

## Overview

This directory contains all process-related documentation that defines how the FHIR4DS development team operates, including roles, workflows, standards, and quality gates.

## Documents

### Core Process Documents
- **[Roles and Responsibilities](roles-and-responsibilities.md)** - Team member roles and their responsibilities
- **[PEP Process](pep-process.md)** - Project Enhancement Proposal workflow
- **[Git Workflow](git-workflow.md)** - Version control and branching strategy
- **[Quality Gates](quality-gates.md)** - Testing and validation requirements

### Technical Standards
- **[Architecture Overview](architecture-overview.md)** - High-level system architecture principles
- **[Coding Standards](coding-standards.md)** - Code style, patterns, and conventions

## Process Philosophy

The FHIR4DS project follows a structured, collaborative approach inspired by Python's PEP process:

1. **Plan First** - All significant changes require documented proposals
2. **Peer Review** - Senior architects review all proposals and implementations
3. **Incremental Progress** - Break large changes into manageable steps
4. **Quality Focus** - Comprehensive testing and standards compliance
5. **Documentation Driven** - Maintain clear documentation throughout

## Key Principles

### Architectural Consistency
- **Population Analytics First** - Design for population-scale processing
- **CTE-First SQL** - Leverage Common Table Expressions for performance
- **Multi-Dialect Support** - DuckDB and PostgreSQL compatibility
- **Standards Compliance** - 100% compliance with FHIR specifications

### Development Quality
- **Root Cause Fixes** - Address underlying issues, not symptoms
- **Stepwise Implementation** - Small, focused changes with clear boundaries
- **Comprehensive Testing** - All database dialects, all test categories
- **No Hardcoded Values** - Configuration-driven, flexible deployment

### Team Collaboration
- **Clear Roles** - Defined responsibilities and decision-making authority
- **Transparent Process** - All decisions documented and reviewable
- **Knowledge Sharing** - Documentation supports team scalability
- **Continuous Improvement** - Regular process evaluation and refinement
