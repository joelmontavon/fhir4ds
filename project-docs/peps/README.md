# Project Enhancement Proposals (PEPs)

## Overview

This directory contains all Project Enhancement Proposals (PEPs) for FHIR4DS development. The PEP process, inspired by Python's PEP system, ensures systematic planning, thorough review, and quality implementation of significant changes to the codebase.

## PEP Process Philosophy

The FHIR4DS PEP process balances thorough planning with efficient execution:

- **Systematic Planning**: Major changes require structured proposals with clear requirements
- **Collaborative Review**: Senior Solution Architect/Engineer reviews all proposals before implementation
- **Quality Focus**: Implementation includes comprehensive testing and compliance validation
- **Knowledge Capture**: Completed PEPs document lessons learned and implementation outcomes

## Directory Structure

## Current PEPs

### Architectural PEPs
The unified FHIRPath architecture is implemented through systematic PEPs:

#### **Core Architecture PEPs**
- **[PEP-001](drafts/)**: **FHIRPath Engine with CTE Generation** - Single execution foundation
- **[PEP-002](drafts/)**: **Thin Dialect Architecture** - Syntax-only database adaptation

#### **Specification Integration PEPs**
- **[PEP-003](drafts/)**: **SQL-on-FHIR Translation Layer** - ViewDefinition→FHIRPath conversion
- **[PEP-004](drafts/)**: **CQL Translation Layer** - CQL→FHIRPath conversion with monolithic execution

#### **Enhancement PEPs**
- **[PEP-005](drafts/)**: **Quality Measure Framework** - eCQI Framework implementation
- **[PEP-006](drafts/)**: **Population Analytics Optimization** - Performance tuning for scale

### Architectural Alignment
All PEPs implement the unified FHIRPath architecture principles:
- **Single Execution Path**: FHIRPath foundation for all specifications
- **CTE-First Design**: Population-optimized SQL generation
- **Thin Dialects**: Database syntax translation without business logic

## PEP Numbering System

### Numbering Rules
- **Sequential Assignment**: PEPs numbered sequentially starting from 001
- **Cross-Stage Consistency**: PEP number maintained through all lifecycle stages
- **No Reuse**: Rejected PEP numbers are not reused for new proposals
- **Draft Numbering**: Drafts use temporary numbers until promotion to active

### Number Ranges
- **001-099**: Core architecture and foundational changes
- **100-199**: Feature implementations and enhancements
- **200-299**: Performance optimizations and scalability improvements
- **300-399**: Process improvements and tooling enhancements
- **400+**: Future categories as project grows

### Current Number Assignment
- **Next Available**: PEP-001 (first major architectural change)
- **Reserved**: Numbers 001-010 for initial major architectural PEPs

## Success Metrics

### Process Effectiveness
- **PEP Completion Rate**: Percentage of accepted PEPs successfully implemented
- **Review Turnaround Time**: Average time from submission to decision
- **Implementation Quality**: Defect rate in PEP-implemented features
- **Developer Satisfaction**: Team feedback on PEP process effectiveness

### Project Outcomes
- **Architecture Quality**: System maintains architectural principles through PEP process
- **Standards Compliance**: PEPs advance toward 100% specification compliance goals
- **Feature Delivery**: Consistent delivery of valuable functionality through PEPs
- **Technical Debt**: Minimal accumulation through disciplined PEP process

### Compliance Impact Tracking
PEPs implement the unified FHIRPath architecture for 100% specification compliance:

| Specification | Target | PEP Architecture Impact |
|---------------|--------|------------------------|
| **FHIRPath R4** | 100% | **PEP-001**: Core execution engine foundation |
| **SQL-on-FHIR** | 100% | **PEP-003**: Translation to FHIRPath patterns |
| **CQL Framework** | 100% | **PEP-004**: Monolithic execution through FHIRPath |
| **Quality Measures** | 100% | **PEP-005**: eCQI Framework via CQL translation |
