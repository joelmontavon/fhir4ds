### From Archived Implementation

#### Test Integration Patterns (`archive/tests/run_tests.py`)
**Lines 50-150**: Test execution and reporting patterns
```python
# Study test execution patterns:
def run_official_tests(test_suite_path):
    """Execute official test cases with reporting"""
    # Pattern for batch test execution
    # Result collection and analysis
```
**What to reuse**: Test execution framework patterns
**What to improve**: Better reporting, automated analysis

## Testing Strategy

### Test Execution Strategy
- **Categorized Execution**: Run tests by category for targeted analysis
- **Parallel Execution**: Use pytest-xdist for faster test suite execution
- **Failure Analysis**: Automated analysis of failure patterns and root causes
- **Regression Detection**: Compare results across test runs to detect regressions

### Performance Validation
- **Baseline Establishment**: Create performance baseline for all test categories
- **Regression Monitoring**: Detect performance regressions across test runs
- **Optimization Targeting**: Identify specific test cases needing optimization

### Compliance Reporting
- **Real-time Dashboard**: Live compliance status with pass/fail breakdown
- **Trend Analysis**: Compliance improvement over time
- **Category Analysis**: Compliance by FHIRPath feature category
- **Failure Root Cause**: Automated analysis of common failure patterns

## Risk Assessment

### Technical Risks
| Risk | Probability | Impact | Mitigation |
|------|-------------|--------|------------|
| Test suite download/access issues | Low | High | Mirror test suite in repository |
| Initial low compliance rate | High | Medium | Expect iterative improvement, plan for parser fixes |
| Performance issues with large test suite | Medium | Medium | Implement parallel execution and optimization |

### Implementation Challenges
1. **Test Case Complexity**: Some official tests may have edge cases not covered in parser
2. **Performance at Scale**: 934 test cases may reveal performance issues
3. **CI/CD Integration**: Ensuring reliable automated testing across environments

### Contingency Plans
- **If compliance is initially low**: Create prioritized improvement plan based on failure analysis
- **If performance is poor**: Implement test case batching and parallel execution
- **If CI/CD is unreliable**: Fall back to scheduled local execution with manual reporting

Phase 2 Target: 95% compliance (890/934 tests)
Phase 3 Target: 100% compliance (934/934 tests)
```

### Performance Benchmarks
- **Simple Tests**: <1ms average parsing time
- **Complex Tests**: <10ms average parsing time
- **Total Suite**: <30 seconds complete execution
- **Memory Usage**: <100MB peak memory during full test run
