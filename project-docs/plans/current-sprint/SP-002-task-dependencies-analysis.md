### Dependency Relationships

#### Sequential Dependencies (Critical Path)
1. **SP-002-001 → SP-002-002**:
   - Test infrastructure must be operational before implementing functions
   - Function development guided by test failures and compliance measurement
   - **Dependency Type**: Data/Information dependency

2. **SP-002-002 → SP-002-004**:
   - Architecture fixes should not break implemented functions
   - Metadata inference needs to understand function semantics
   - **Dependency Type**: Implementation dependency

3. **SP-002-004 → SP-002-005**:
   - Performance testing requires stable architecture
   - Clean architecture ensures accurate performance measurement
   - **Dependency Type**: Quality dependency

#### Parallel Development Opportunities
1. **SP-002-003 || SP-002-002**:
   - Literal support independent of function implementation
   - Both enhance parser capabilities without interference
   - **Overlap Period**: Days 6-8 (3 days parallel work)

2. **SP-002-006 || SP-002-004 + SP-002-005**:
   - Documentation can begin once features are implemented
   - Does not impact architecture or performance work
   - **Overlap Period**: Days 14-15 (2 days parallel work)

## Critical Path Analysis

### Critical Path Tasks (Sequential)
1. **SP-002-001: Test Infrastructure** (Days 1-5)
   - **Why Critical**: All subsequent work depends on test framework
   - **Risk**: Delays in test setup block entire sprint
   - **Mitigation**: Start immediately, allocate best resources

2. **SP-002-002: Function Library** (Days 6-12)
   - **Why Critical**: Longest task, enables major compliance improvement
   - **Risk**: Function complexity may cause delays
   - **Mitigation**: Implement core functions first, defer advanced functions if needed

3. **SP-002-004: Architecture Compliance** (Days 13-15)
   - **Why Critical**: Clean foundation required for future development
   - **Risk**: Architecture changes may introduce regressions
   - **Mitigation**: Comprehensive testing, gradual implementation

4. **SP-002-005: Performance Validation** (Days 13-15)
   - **Why Critical**: Production readiness validation
   - **Risk**: Performance issues may require optimization work
   - **Mitigation**: Continuous monitoring, optimize critical paths

### Critical Path Optimization Strategies
1. **Parallel Work Within Tasks**: Use pair programming and task splitting where possible
2. **Early Risk Identification**: Daily monitoring of critical path progress
3. **Resource Shifting**: Move resources to critical path if non-critical tasks ahead of schedule
4. **Scope Flexibility**: Defer non-essential features if critical path at risk

## Parallel Development Strategies

### Strategy 1: Literal Support Parallel (Days 6-8)
**Parallel Tasks**: SP-002-002 (Functions) || SP-002-003 (Literals)

**Benefits**:
- Saves 3 days overall sprint time
- Independent development reduces coordination overhead
- Different skill requirements (architecture vs. parsing)

**Coordination Requirements**:
- Daily sync to ensure no parser integration conflicts
- Shared testing framework usage coordination
- Common error handling pattern alignment

**Risk Mitigation**:
- Clear API boundaries between function and literal parsing
- Independent testing until integration phase
- Senior architect oversight of both tracks

### Strategy 2: Documentation Parallel (Days 14-15)
**Parallel Tasks**: SP-002-004 + SP-002-005 || SP-002-006 (Documentation)

**Benefits**:
- Documentation starts as features stabilize
- No impact on critical technical work
- Earlier documentation completion

**Coordination Requirements**:
- Documentation tracks feature completion
- Examples validated against implemented features
- Regular updates as features evolve

## Risk Analysis by Dependency Type

### Blocking Dependencies (High Risk)
1. **SP-002-001 → SP-002-002**: Test infrastructure failure blocks function development
   - **Impact**: 7-day delay if test setup fails
   - **Mitigation**: Immediate test setup, fallback to manual testing
   - **Contingency**: Simplified test framework if complex setup fails

2. **SP-002-002 → SP-002-004**: Major function issues could delay architecture work
   - **Impact**: 3-day delay if function implementation unstable
   - **Mitigation**: Core function subset approach, incremental implementation
   - **Contingency**: Architecture work proceeds with basic functions only

### Information Dependencies (Medium Risk)
1. **SP-002-001 → All Tasks**: Test results guide implementation priorities
   - **Impact**: Sub-optimal implementation priorities
   - **Mitigation**: Early test execution, iterative priority adjustment
   - **Contingency**: Proceed with estimated priorities if test data unavailable

### Quality Dependencies (Low Risk)
1. **SP-002-004 → SP-002-005**: Architecture quality affects performance measurement
   - **Impact**: Inaccurate performance measurement
   - **Mitigation**: Basic performance testing during architecture work
   - **Contingency**: Re-run performance tests after architecture stabilizes

### Critical Handoff Points
1. **Day 5**: SP-002-001 → SP-002-002 handoff (test infrastructure ready)
2. **Day 8**: SP-002-003 → SP-002-005 handoff (literals ready for performance testing)
3. **Day 12**: SP-002-002 → SP-002-004 handoff (functions stable for architecture work)
4. **Day 14**: SP-002-004 → SP-002-006 handoff (architecture stable for documentation)

## Optimization Recommendations

### Immediate Optimizations
1. **Pre-work**: Begin SP-002-001 preparation immediately (test case research, tool setup)
2. **Resource Front-loading**: Allocate best resources to critical path start
3. **Parallel Setup**: Prepare SP-002-003 environment while SP-002-002 in progress

### Contingency Planning
1. **Scope Reduction**: Identify minimum viable function set if SP-002-002 delayed
2. **Resource Reallocation**: Plan for shifting resources to critical path if needed
3. **Timeline Extension**: 2-day buffer available if critical path extends

### Success Acceleration
1. **Early Completion**: If tasks complete early, advance subsequent tasks
2. **Quality Enhancement**: Use time savings for additional testing and optimization
3. **Scope Expansion**: Consider additional functions if sprint ahead of schedule
