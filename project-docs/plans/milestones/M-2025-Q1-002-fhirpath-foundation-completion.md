# Milestone: FHIRPath Foundation Critical Completion

**Milestone ID**: M-2025-Q1-002
**Milestone Name**: FHIRPath Foundation Critical Completion
**Owner**: Senior Solution Architect/Engineer
**Target Date**: 3 weeks from approval
**Status**: Planning
**Depends On**: M-2025-Q1-001 (FHIRPath Parser and AST Foundation)

---

## Milestone Overview

### Strategic Objective
Complete the critical missing components of the FHIRPath foundation to achieve measurable specification compliance and clean architecture before proceeding to CTE generation. This milestone focuses on the essential gaps identified in PEP-001 implementation review rather than attempting 100% specification coverage.

### Business Value
- **Measurable Compliance**: Establish baseline through official test suite integration (currently unmeasured)
- **Core Function Completeness**: Implement essential FHIRPath functions required for realistic healthcare expressions
- **Architecture Integrity**: Remove violations and ensure clean foundation for CTE generation
- **Production Readiness**: Validate performance and establish benchmarking framework

### Success Statement
FHIRPath parser achieves measurable compliance against official test suite (target: 70%+), implements core function library, and eliminates architecture violations while maintaining performance targets.
