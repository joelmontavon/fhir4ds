    ↓
+ feat/sp-001-004-test-framework (connect real testing)
    ↓
+ feature/sp-001-007-perf-test-framework (connect real performance)
    ↓

```

### Alternative Approaches Considered
- **Big Bang Integration**: Rejected due to complexity and conflict resolution difficulty
- **Separate Integration Branch**: Rejected to maintain `complete-rewrite` as primary branch

## Integration Challenges and Solutions

### Anticipated Integration Challenges

#### 1. Error Handling Conflicts
**Challenge**: Different error handling approaches between branches
**Solution**: Systematic replacement of basic error handling with enhanced error classes
**Mitigation**: Incremental testing after each error handling update

#### 2. Import Path Conflicts
**Challenge**: Different import structures between parser implementations
**Solution**: Standardize on unified import structure from SP-001-005
**Mitigation**: Update all imports systematically and validate with tests

#### 3. Parser Interface Mismatches
**Challenge**: Test and performance frameworks expecting different parser interfaces
**Solution**: Update framework interfaces to match real parser API

| Performance degradation from integration overhead | Low | Medium | Performance testing after each integration step |
| Regression in existing functionality | Medium | High | Comprehensive regression testing after each integration |

### Implementation Challenges
1. **Complexity Management**: Multiple branches with different implementation approaches
2. **Interface Compatibility**: Ensuring frameworks work with real parser interfaces
3. **Error Handling Consistency**: Maintaining consistent error handling throughout system
