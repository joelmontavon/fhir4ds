## Risk Assessment

### Technical Risks
| Risk | Probability | Impact | Mitigation |
|------|-------------|--------|------------|
| Grammar complexity leads to parsing ambiguities | Medium | High | Incremental implementation with continuous testing and grammar validation |
| Performance degradation with complex expressions | Medium | Medium | Regular performance benchmarking and optimization focus |
| AST structure inadequate for complex constructs | Low | High | Close collaboration with SP-001-002 implementation and validation |
| Operator precedence implementation errors | Medium | High | Comprehensive test cases and reference implementation validation |

### Implementation Challenges
1. **Grammar Ambiguity Resolution**: FHIRPath has some ambiguous constructs that require careful parsing strategies
2. **Performance with Complex Nesting**: Deep nesting in expressions could impact parsing performance
3. **Error Recovery**: Providing meaningful error messages for complex parsing failures

### Contingency Plans
- **If grammar complexity exceeds timeline**: Focus on most critical grammar constructs first, defer advanced features
- **If performance targets missed**: Implement optimization passes and profiling-guided improvements
- **If AST integration issues arise**: Collaborate with SP-001-002 to adjust AST node design as needed
