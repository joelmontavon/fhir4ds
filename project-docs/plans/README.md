# Project Planning Documentation

## Overview

This directory contains all project planning documentation including sprint plans, task breakdowns, milestone tracking, and project management templates. The planning process follows the PEP-inspired workflow with clear deliverables and success metrics.

## Directory Structure

### Current Sprint (`current-sprint/`)
Active sprint documentation and real-time progress tracking. Contains:
- **Sprint Plan**: Detailed objectives, tasks, and success criteria
- **Sprint Status**: Daily progress updates and blocker identification
- **Task Breakdown**: Individual task specifications and tracking

### Archived Sprints (`archived-sprints/`)
Historical sprint data for analysis and learning. Each archived sprint includes:
- **Sprint Plan**: Original planning documentation
- **Sprint Status**: Final status and completion metrics
- **Sprint Retrospective**: Lessons learned and process improvements
- **Task Breakdown**: Complete task history and outcomes

### Milestones (`milestones/`)
Long-term project milestones and strategic objectives. Includes:
- **Architecture Milestones**: Major architectural achievements
- **Compliance Milestones**: Specification compliance targets
- **Performance Milestones**: Performance and scalability goals

### Templates (`templates/`)
Standardized templates for consistent planning and tracking:
- **Sprint Plan Template**: Structure for sprint planning
- **Task Template**: Individual task specification format
- **Milestone Template**: Long-term objective definition

## Planning Philosophy

### Sprint-Based Development
- **2-Week Sprints**: Consistent sprint length for predictable delivery
- **Clear Objectives**: Each sprint has specific, measurable goals
- **Task Granularity**: Tasks sized for 4-8 hour completion windows
- **Progress Tracking**: Daily status updates and issue identification

### Milestone-Driven Strategy
- **Quarterly Milestones**: Major objectives aligned with business goals
- **Compliance Focus**: Milestones tied to specification compliance targets
- **Performance Benchmarks**: Measurable performance improvements
- **Architectural Evolution**: Progressive system improvement

### Quality Integration
- **Definition of Done**: Clear completion criteria for all work
- **Testing Requirements**: Comprehensive testing at task and sprint level
- **Review Gates**: Architecture review before implementation
- **Compliance Verification**: Continuous compliance monitoring

## Success Metrics

### Sprint Success Indicators
- **Completion Rate**: Percentage of planned tasks completed
- **Quality Metrics**: Test coverage and defect rates
- **Velocity Consistency**: Stable story point completion over time
- **Blocker Resolution**: Time to resolve impediments

### Milestone Achievement
- **Compliance Progress**: Advancement toward 100% specification compliance
- **Performance Targets**: Achievement of population-scale performance goals
- **Architecture Quality**: Maintenance of architectural principles
- **Team Productivity**: Consistent delivery and skill development
